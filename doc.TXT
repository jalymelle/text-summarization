A person is taxed based on their income. There are two types of taxes, direct and indirect. I will start by talking about direct taxes. First, they are taxed the direct federal tax. That is based on the amount of money they make and the tax rate.
Next, people pay taxes to their canton and municipality. Here they pay taxes on their income and their property. The tax rate of cantons and municipalities varies quite a lot between different cantons and municipalities. Finally, people belonging to a church also pay a church tax which is based on the State tax and church tax rate.
 In addition to direct taxes, people pay indirect taxes. Indirect taxes are paid every time you buy something, a percentage of the price goes to the State. This is called the value-added tax. 
So, now that you know what type of taxes people pay, letâ€™s move on to the article for this topic.
